- Finished watching anime
- Dropped webtoon manga because of too many episodes to watch

## Personal Review
The anime seemed to get too rushed in my opinion. Also, there some edited scenes when the protagonist lose to the side protagonist, and then accepting their defeat. However, in the anime, the protagonist triumph the side protagonist by simply the double dragon kicks, even though the opponents have nine-tailed fox power that can easily overcome the protagonist's strength.
